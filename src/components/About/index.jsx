        <p>
            Hi, I'm Suniel, aka Sunny. A FrontEnd web developer in the making. Abit about me, I'm 26, from Birmingham and I enjoy all things tech.
            I have an MEng in Chemical Engineering, a subject that I found very interesting but not something I would like to do as a long term career.
            Coding on the other hand, is something I do see myself doing long term. Currently I know a few languages, such as Java, C#, HTML and CSS.
        </p>
